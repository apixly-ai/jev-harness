name: jev-harness
description: Use a Jev-native agent loop for bounded multi-step tasks when an AI can define trusted tools, meaningful parameter candidates and independent success checks. Generate a task script, run it once and handle terminal evidence; keep exact/fixed work in code and open reasoning in the primary model.

# Jev Harness

Read `jev-harness spec` first. This is a task-script runtime, not a tool interception hook
or a replacement for the primary AI. Prefer it when repeated next-tool/parameter decisions
are semantic and the available action domain and success condition can be bounded.

1. Define the goal, scope, observable success, admitted facts and conversation.
2. `jev-harness init-task task.py` creates a runnable offline scaffold.
3. Register explicit keyword-callable tools with Task.tool; use Parameter descriptions,
   static/dynamic choices and depends_on for related arguments. Use Option to separate
   safe descriptions from private values. Never ask Jev to invent an ID or command.
4. Keep observe/candidate callbacks read-only. Admit safe results via result_context.
5. Test synthetic callback behavior. `check-task` checks syntax/export only, no execution.
6. Tell the user what goal, observation and tool/parameter candidates Jev will receive.
7. Submit one `jev-harness run ...` call. Inference is billable; use caller-approved credentials.
8. Parse terminal JSON even on exit 2. Only independently verified done means completion.

Do not retry ambiguous external execution. Caller tools own identity, authorization,
idempotency, business transactions and reconciliation. Scripts are trusted Python, not a
sandbox. Protect private journals; recover only necessary evidence for unresolved items.

Use generic browser/desktop adapters only within their platform and target scope. Headless
Camofox must preserve the named session; native desktop needs an unlocked target app.
No declared adapter means no claim of application coverage. Exact selectors/IDs/computation
and fixed sequences need no inference; open-ended generation remains with the primary AI.

See the repository docs/agent-contract.md, docs/context.md and docs/adapters.md for the
complete contracts. Tool and parameter domains are recomputed; no result caching.
